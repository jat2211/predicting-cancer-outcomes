# predicting-cancer-outcomes
## Introduction
Data science project that predicts whether or not a patient with lung cancer lives at followup session with initial diagnosis of the cancer acting as data for each patient. update

## Data Exploration and Visualization
update
## Pre-Processing
update

## Results
I used a random forest machine learning model that predicted the outcomes with [X]% accuracy. This accuracy is an improvement on the [BASELINE ACC].

I wrote a detailed 2-page report on many of the decisions I made in pre-processing to manipulate and expand the dataset, as well as detail the shortcomings of the project and further steps that could have been taken, as this project was completed under a time constraint. update

## Skills Used
- decision trees
- bagging (random forest model)
- Pandas
- one-hot encoding
- data cleaning and expansion
- **Broader domains: machine learning, data science, data manipulation**
